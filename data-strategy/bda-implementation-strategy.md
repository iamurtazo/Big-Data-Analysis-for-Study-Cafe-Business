## 4. Analytics Use Cases and Applications

### 4.1 Customer Experience Optimization

**Personalized Recommendations**
```python
# Customer preference analysis
def analyze_customer_preferences(customer_id):
    # Analyze purchase history, study patterns, time preferences
    purchase_data = get_customer_purchases(customer_id)
    study_patterns = get_study_sessions(customer_id)
    
    # Generate personalized recommendations
    beverage_recommendations = recommend_beverages(purchase_data)
    optimal_study_times = predict_best_study_times(study_patterns)
    
    return {
        'beverages': beverage_recommendations,
        'study_times': optimal_study_times,
        'seating_preferences': analyze_seating_patterns(customer_id)
    }
```

**Dynamic Pricing Strategy**
```python
# Demand-based pricing model
def calculate_dynamic_pricing(time_slot, day_of_week, occupancy_forecast):
    base_price = get_base_pricing()
    demand_multiplier = calculate_demand_factor(time_slot, day_of_week)
    occupancy_factor = adjust_for_occupancy(occupancy_forecast)
    
    final_price = base_price * demand_multiplier * occupancy_factor
    return round(final_price, 2)
```

### 4.2 Operational Intelligence

**Demand Forecasting**
```python
# Predict customer demand for capacity planning
import sklearn.ensemble as ensemble
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def forecast_daily_demand():
    # Feature engineering
    features = create_demand_features()  # weather, events, holidays, historical
    
    # Random Forest model for demand prediction
    model = ensemble.RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(features, historical_demand)
    
    # Predict next 7 days
    future_demand = model.predict(future_features)
    return future_demand
```

```python
# Optimize inventory based on predicted demand and historical patterns
def optimize_inventory():
    demand_forecast = get_demand_forecast()
    historical_sales = get_sales_data()
    
    # Calculate optimal inventory levels
    for item in menu_items:
        safety_stock = calculate_safety_stock(item)
        reorder_point = calculate_reorder_point(item, demand_forecast)
        optimal_quantity = economic_order_quantity(item)
        
        inventory_recommendations[item] = {
            'current_stock': get_current_stock(item),
            'reorder_point': reorder_point,
            'order_quantity': optimal_quantity
        }
    
    return inventory_recommendations
```

### 4.3 Marketing Analytics

    # Calculate RFM scores
    rfm_data = calculate_rfm_scores(customer_data)
    
    # K-means clustering for segmentation
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
    segments = kmeans.fit_predict(rfm_data)
    
    return create_segment_profiles(segments)
```

**Campaign Effectiveness Analysis**
```python
# Measure marketing campaign ROI

        'reach': len(campaign_data['recipients']),
        'engagement_rate': calculate_engagement_rate(customer_response),

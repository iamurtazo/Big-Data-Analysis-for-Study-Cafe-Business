### **Slide 2: Use Case Briefing (1.5 minutes)**
```
VISUAL: Split screen - traditional café vs. study-optimized space
NARRATION:
"I've chosen Use Case 1: Opening a new café business, but with a unique twist. StudyHub Café will be Uzbekistan's first dedicated study café, combining premium coffee service with purpose-built study environments.

The concept addresses a clear market gap: while Tashkent has numerous coffee shops, none offer dedicated study spaces with 24/7 access, noise control, and study-optimized amenities. This creates a blue ocean opportunity in the growing education-focused market."
```

NARRATION:
"Our primary objectives are threefold: First, achieve $180,000 in annual revenue with 1,500 registered members in Year 1. Second, establish market leadership in the premium study space segment. Third, create a scalable, data-driven business model for regional expansion.

Success will be measured through customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, space utilization rates, and customer satisfaction scores."
```

**SLIDES TO INCLUDE**:
- Revenue projection chart

### **Slide 4: Target Customer Analysis (1 minute)**
```
VISUAL: Customer persona cards with demographics and behavior patterns
NARRATION:
"Our target market consists of three primary segments: University students (70%), who need focused study environments; high school students (20%), preparing for exams; and working professionals (10%), pursuing continuing education.

Key customer insights from market research show 78% of students struggle with noisy environments in current coffee shops, and 76% want flexible, extended study hours. Our value proposition directly addresses these pain points."
